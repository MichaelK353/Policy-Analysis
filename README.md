**Poland's Nuclear Energy Program MSA**//
Two decades after Poland abandoned construction of its first nuclear power plant in 1990, the country
once again chose to develop the controversial energy source. This essay uses John Kingdon’s Multiple
Streams framework (Kingdon, 1984) to explain Poland’s original decision to develop nuclear energy,
why the programme failed, and why it has restarted. The analysis provides timely decision-making
guidance as Poland’s plans for a new nuclear power plant enter an advanced stage, as well as wider
energy policy agenda-setting lessons.
