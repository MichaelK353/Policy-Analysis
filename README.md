Policy Analysis and Writing Samples


**Poland's Nuclear Energy Program MSA:** Two decades after Poland abandoned construction of its first nuclear power plant in 1990, the country
once again chose to develop the controversial energy source. This essay uses John Kingdon’s Multiple
Streams framework (Kingdon, 1984) to explain Poland’s original decision to develop nuclear energy,
why the programme failed, and why it has restarted. The analysis provides timely decision-making
guidance as Poland’s plans for a new nuclear power plant enter an advanced stage, as well as wider
energy policy agenda-setting lessons.


**Carbon Trading Comparative Analysis:** The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is compared and evaluated alongside California's Cap and Trade (C&T) Scheme. Evaluation using a literature review and emperical analysis of recent emissions data is conducted. Additionally, policy efficiency of the schemes is compared other policy instruments. The theoretical literature extending the findings of Weitzman, 1974, argue that a Carbon Tax is more efficient. This essay challenges that literature, arguing the existing carbon trading schemes are prefferable. 


**Energy Crisis Policy Response:** This policy brief reflects on Ireland's response to the 2022 energy crisis precipitated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to inform a hypothetical emergency response to closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Shortcomings of the 2022 response are highlighted, including rising energy poverty, and a failure to accelerate key infrastructure delivery. Price dynamics are analysed, and adjustments to fiscal support and infrastructure delivery are recommended.


**Technology Policy Stringency and Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Statistical/Econometric analysis of the relationship between technology policy stringency and GHG Emissions reductions. First Difference OLS and Differenence-in-Difference models were used to investigate causality. Policy recommendations were made based on the findings.
